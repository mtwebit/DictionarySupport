# DictionarySupport
Dictionary support module for ProcessWire

## Work in progress
Please note that this module is not finished and it is in continuous development as of October, 2017.

## Purpose
This module provides support for importing, storing, displaying and using dictionary entries in ProcessWire.  
It can handle a large number of headwords (tested with 15k+ entries) with low memory requirements and javascript-based execution of long-running tasks.  
The software was developed for the [Mikes-dictionary project].

## Installation
First, ensure that your ProcessWire installation and the underlying database meets the encoding and indexing requirements of your projects. Their default settings probably won't work for you if you store materials in languages other than English. See Encoding.txt for more details.  
After creating your ProcessWire site, install the module the usual way and follow the instructions on the module's home page.
